This is a simple client-server socket program for an assignment in an introductory computer networking class in college. 

It is based on Node.js, Express and Socket.IO.

The basic functions of this program are to:
    - connect a client to a server via local localhost at port 8888
    - send any strings entered by the cilent(s) through a cilent-side web-based interface to the server
    - reverse the order of the characters in every word of the received string and returns it back to the cilent-side interface

The actual codes are based on the example illustrated on the Socket.IO documentation examples.
